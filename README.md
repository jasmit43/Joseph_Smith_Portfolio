# Project 1: KPI Dashboard

This is a project that was created to provide metric results for each group and the group members from multiple datasets.

* Data was taken from Teradata database, Snowflake database, SharePoint, and source systems.
* The dashboard was structured for an overview of their metrics.
* If more in-depth views of each metric were needed, there were specific metric pages that provided that information.
* Each page provided slicers for the end user to filter the data to their specific needs.
